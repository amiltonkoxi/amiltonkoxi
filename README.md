# 👋 Amilton Koxi — Engineer in IoT, Cloud & Intelligent Systems

I work across the intersection of **embedded systems, cloud computing, intelligent networking, and applied machine learning**.  
My focus is creating **efficient, secure, and scalable** architectures that transform real-world sensor data into actionable intelligence — from **edge devices** to **cloud platforms**.

I enjoy building systems where **hardware awareness**, **algorithmic efficiency**, and **cloud-native automation** come together.

## 🔧 How I Work

My engineering approach blends **low-level hardware design**, **network-aware communication**,  
and **cloud-native automation** to build systems that are:

- **Robust** under unreliable communication  
- **Efficient** in power, performance, and data flow  
- **Scalable** from prototype to distributed deployment  
- **Secure** at the protocol and infrastructure level  

I typically work on:

- Long-range IoT and wireless communication  
- Real-time sensing, data acquisition, and embedded optimization  
- Edge-accelerated computation (HLS, hardware-aware design)  
- Distributed cloud/data pipelines and microservices  
- Network modeling, simulation, and performance tuning  
- Intelligent systems powered by ML-driven automation
